### Overview
This document provides the guidelines for fabricating femto-scale circuit boards, detailing the materials, tools, and techniques required.

### Materials
- Graphene: Ultra-high conductivity, used for interconnects.
- Silicon: Base material for some components.

### Tools
- Electron Beam Lithography (EBL) System: For precision patterning.
- Atomic Layer Deposition (ALD) System: For thin film deposition.

### Techniques
- Cleanroom Standards: All fabrication must be conducted in a Class 100 cleanroom or better.
- Quality Control: Each step must be monitored using high-resolution microscopy.

### Safety
Ensure all personnel are trained in handling nano-scale materials and operate under strict safety protocols.
